        'NAV sin pensjonsløsning, Pesys, har i mange år vært blant Norges største og mest komplekse kodebaser. Opprinnelig skrevet med teknologi, som i dag, ville fått utviklere til å gråte. Vi skal i dette foredraget fortelle hvordan vi har modernisert det grafiske brukergrensesnittet. Vi skal rett og slett fortelle deg en ærlig historie om hvordan vår erfaring med dette var. Vi kommer til å snakke om den moderne retningen som premissgiver, hvor vi måtte ta tak i både menneskelige og tekniske utfordringer. På veien skal vi også prate om hvordan vi organiserte teamene og folkene, og fortelle hvordan vi tok tak i arkitekturen og det sosiotekniske aspektet av det. Du skal på den måten lære hvorfor vi mener dette økte selvsikkerheten og eierskapet til alle involverte.  Videre deler vi hvordan vi har løst de tekniske utfordringene omkring implementasjon; integrasjon og sikkerhet ved å blant annet bruke api gateways og micro-frontends. Etter å ha hørt foredraget vil du være i stand til å bedre ta tak i modernisering av legacy-kodebase i din organisasjon.',

This presentation will look into the different branches of software licenses and open source. In this context, the presentation will discuss common terms of commercial agreements and what pitfalls to avoid. Finally, this presentation will look into the OpenJDK project and its formal organization. Attendees will gain a solid understanding of the legal and technical considerations of choosing licensed software, enabling them to make informed decisions about their projects.',

In this session we will make a comparison between traditional Elasticsearch and OpenSearch to understand is going completely free and open source a save path.',

Manually maintaining environments to test the correctness of the entire system is undevops-like and fragile.\n\nLuckily, modern tools can help you to build automated, reliable test pipelines, and in this session, we explore how using Spring Cloud Contract and Testcontainers together can improve your testing and deployment processes.\n\nSpring Cloud Contract is an implementation of Consumer-Driven Contracts, an approach that provides a way to easily describe and verify APIs, at the same time allowing building API backward compatibility verification into the deployment process.\n\nTestcontainers lets developers programmatically build test environments consisting of real services running in lightweight and disposable containers. It turns the process of integration testing into a seamless, unit-test-like experience.\n\nIn this presentation, we’ll show how contract and integration tests complement each other and explore one of the most natural and reliable approaches to service evolution with contract testing. We’ll discuss why in Spring Cloud Contract, we’ve decided to switch to using Testcontainers as the solution for Kafka and AMQP messaging verification and demonstrate practical use-cases and code examples of how to set up both types of tests in your applications and deployment pipelines.',
